# UResources
UResource lets users upload items they want to sell by writing a short description and uploading a picture and other user can buy it. It allows users to put up a post for ride-sharing including all the logistical details and those who want to share the ride may contact them using the contact information provided.

# Inspiration
UResource is a simple yet powerful project with the aim to create a one-stop digital marketplace where UMass students can effortlessly connect, trade, and collaborate. We recognized the need for a seamless platform where students can buy and sell academic resources—like i-clickers, textbooks, or old study materials—without the hassle of physical advertisements or crowded bulletin boards. But UResource is more than just a marketplace for people to buy/sell preloved items! It’s a hub for students to find reliable, affordable rideshares for commuting, making it easier and cheaper to travel whilst reducing the stress of transportation logistics.<br />
What truly makes UResource unique is it being a space for students with side hustles to showcase their skills, whether it's offering services like nail care, barbering, or room cleaning—all for a price decided by them. UResource aims to bring people together, making it simpler to find the help you need!
